A new way to make todolists in minecraft!
You can download the .phar from <a href="https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/SignTodos">poggit</a>.
You always forget what you wanted to do in your minecraft world, but you don't want to use external todolists? Then this plugin is the perfect tool for you!
<br>SignTodos lets you create a todolists inside minecraft using a text pattern on signs and view all your todosigns via a command.
# How to use?
1. Place a sign
2. Write something like "//TODO: Finish this building" on it. You can view all todo patterns below
3. You can now view all your signs-todos with /todos

# Todo pattern
The pattern for todos is:

<br>// todo: example todo (any amount of space between // and todo is valid) Whether the word "todo" is uppercase or lowercase doesn't matter.
<br>Example signs that would be a todosign:
<br>//todo: download the plugin
<br>// todo: add it to the server
<br>// TODO: Restart the server
